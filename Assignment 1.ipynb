    "    Multiplication of two integers is essentially repeated addition (if they have the same sign) or repeated subtraction \n",
    "    (if they have the opposite sign). Hence, using we can iteratively add/subtract the absolute value of one of the numbers \n",
    "    as many times as the absolute value of the other number. This iteration starts by initialising the product as 0 and then\n",
    "    proceeding with the repeated addition/subtraction.\n",
    "    \n",

    "                  -5 x 3 = 0 - 5 - 5 - 5 = -15      5 is subtracted from 0 three (3) times\n",

    "    with the smaller absolute value, i.e., min(|a|,|b|). The larger number is repeatedly added/subtracted. For example,\n",
